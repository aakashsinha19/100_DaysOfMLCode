# 100_Days_Of_ML_Code_Challenge

### I have taken up this challenge for my personal development in the field of Machine Learning and Arificial Intelligence.

### 100 Days of ML Code Challenge	Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless.
 
### I am starting the #100DaysOfMLCode from today. My objective would be to brush up the basics of Machine Learning using Python in the initial days and then deep dive into developing some real life applications using Deep Learning. Its really a great initiative by Siraj Raval and I thank him for that. 
 
### Here is the Github Repo link for the guidelines of the challenge -

### I am taking up the 100 Days of ML Code as a committment to better my understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of my time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.


## Let's do some ML!
